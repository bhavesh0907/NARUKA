"Introducing Naruka, a groundbreaking project dedicated to making gaming more inclusive for everyone, especially those with physical disabilities. Our mission is to enhance the gaming experience by developing a computer vision-based gamepad emulator that offers a new level of accessibility and customization.

Naruka aims to decrease dependency on traditional game controllers, allowing users to enjoy a wide range of games that were previously inaccessible. With Naruka, users can customize their gaming experience by choosing their preferred level of motion sensitivity, ensuring a personalized and immersive gaming experience for all.

Join us in breaking down barriers and creating a gaming environment where everyone can play and thrive. Naruka is not just a project; it's a movement towards inclusivity and empowerment in gaming."
